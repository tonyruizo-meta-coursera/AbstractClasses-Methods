# Lab Instructions: Abstract Classes and Methods

In this assignment, you will be creating an abstract class for a bank that will be used to create a regular class for a specific bank.  
This class will contain the implementation of the abstract method from the abstract class.

## Exercise Instructions

### Instructions

1. Create a class called `Bank` and pass `ABC` to it.  

2. Inside the class you have to define two methods: 
    - 2.1: Define a function called `basicinfo()` and add a print statement inside it saying   
    `"This is a generic bank"` and returning the string `"Generic bank: 0"`. 

    - 2.2: Define a second function called `withdraw` and keep it empty by adding a pass keyword under it.   
    Make this function abstract by adding `'@abstractmethod'` right above it. <br><br>

3. Create another class called `Swiss` and pass the class `Bank` inside it. 
    This means you are inheriting from `class Bank`. 
    -  3.1: Create a constructor for this class that initializes a class variable `bal` to `1000` <br><br>

4. Override both functions from the Bank class: `basicinfo()` and `withdraw()`. 
    - 4.1: Define a function called `basicinfo()` and add a print statement inside it stating `“This is the Swiss Bank”`  
    and returning a string with `"Swiss Bank: "` followed by the current bank balance.   
    For example, if `self.bal = 80`, then it would return `"Swiss Bank: 80"`

    - 4.2 Define a second function,  called `withdraw` and pass one parameter to it (other than `self`): amount.  
     Amount represents the amount that will be withdrawn. 

        - 4.2.1: Update the class variable bal by deducting the value of amount from it. 
        - 4.2.2: Print the value of amount giving output such as: “Withdrawn amount: 30"
        - 4.2.3:  Print the new balance giving an output such as: “New balance: 970”
        - 4.2.4:  Return the new balance
        - Note: Make sure to verify that there is enough money to withdraw!  
        If amount is greater than balance, then do not deduct any money from the 
        class variable `bal`. Instead, print a statement saying `"Insufficient funds"`, and return the original account balance instead.
